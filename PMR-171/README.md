# PMR-171
## Introduction

In many reaspecte the PMR-171 is very similar to the Q900. The firmware
interface look very similar. 

### DMR
This transceiver can be purchased with DMR support. It do not have
zones as radios like Baofeng DM1701, but each repeater and ascossiated 
talk groups is a channel. With room for only 1000 channels this can soon
be too few. Number of repeaters times number of talkgroups can easily 
reach 1000+ entries. 

The script "make-config-Guohetec" can be used to generate a config file 
that ran be read bu the "GHTerminal" CPE program.
