## Introduction
Code related to ham amateur radio using small single board computers
like Raspberry Pi and Orange Pis. Centred around digital modes and in
particular winlink email using pat.

### Pat for Raspberry Pi
The directory pat contain files and instructions for installing and using pat (and winlink) for email using Raspberry Pi 4. This is currently running nicely onboard Algol.

### Alternative to Raspberry Pi 
The directory OrangePi contain files and information regarding 
using Orange Pi single board computers as alternative to Raspberry Pi.
See : http://orangepi.org for detailed information.

As Raspberry Pi 4 is hard to get by these days evaluating the
alternative Orange Pi 4 (http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/orange-pi-4-LTS.html) is ongoing. The Orange Pi 4 is a 
good alternative.  It comes with a faster processor build in 16 GiB emmc 
memory for OS, no need for a memory card after the initial installation. It runs a 64 bit OS which make installing 32 bits executable an issue.
