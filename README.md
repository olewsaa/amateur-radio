## Introduction
Code related to ham amateur radio using small single board computers
like Raspberry Pi and Orange Pis. Centred around digital modes and in
particular Winlink email using pat.

### Pat for Raspberry Pi
The directory pat contain files and instructions for installing and using pat 
(and Winlink) for email using Raspberry Pi 4. This is currently running nicely 
onboard Algol. 

### Alternative to Raspberry Pi 
The directory OrangePi contain files and information regarding 
using Orange Pi single board computers as alternative to Raspberry Pi.
See [Orange homepage](http://www.orangepi.org/) for detailed information.
The range of offerings are far greater then with Raspberry and supply is
not an issue. 

As Raspberry Pi 4 is hard to come by these days evaluating the
alternative [Orange Pi 4](http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/orange-pi-4-LTS.html) is ongoing. The Orange Pi 4 is a 
good alternative.  It comes with a faster processor build in 16 GiB 
[eMMC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MultiMediaCard#eMMC) 
memory for OS, no need for a memory card after the initial installation. 
The Orange Pi 4 might be overkill, there are smaller boards like Orange Pi 3 or
even smaller that should be powerful enough to run the pat and radio software. 
It runs a 64 bit OS which make installing 32 bits executable an issue.
