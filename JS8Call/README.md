# JS8Call
## Installing
Installing JS8Call on Raspberry Pi4 is relatively straightforward.
Download the ARM 32 bit version from the [JS8Call download site](http://files.js8call.com/latest.html), at time of writing
http://files.js8call.com/2.2.0/js8call_2.2.0_armhf.deb .

In some cases the audio interface selction are blank, this is caused by a missing package, this might help:

```apt install libqt5multimedia5-plugins```
