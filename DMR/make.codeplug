# Script to generate a config file for dmrconfig to program DMR radios.
# Saves a lot of time and effort entering talkgroups by generating
# entries for all talkgroups for all repeaters. It's is (IMHO) less
# work than cut and paste in a spreadsheet interface.
#
# For info about dmrconfig see https://github.com/OpenRTX/dmrconfig/wiki
#
# As an example of what needed to be entered (currently):
# wc -l digital.repeaters.inp are 32 lines. 
# wc -l talkgroups.inp are 27 lines.
# wc -l contacts.inp 29 lines.
# wc -l analog.channels.inp 82 lines long, one per frequency. 
#
#
# A list of contacts/users are included from the radioid
# data base. As only 10k entries are available a selection
# of north European countries are included,

# v1.0.0 18 August 2025 Initial working version.
# v1.0.1 19 August 2025 Bug fixing + spelling.
# v1.0.2 20 August 2025 Bug fix in number of zones.
# v1.0.3 01 September 2025 Added comments and some renaming.
# v1.0.4 27 February 2026 Added users from radioid database.

# The script emit output to standard out, output should be
