## Introduction

My radio is a Baofeng 1701, the codeplug is for this radio and model.

To edit the code plug I use the [TYT Code plug editor](https://www.miklor.com/DMR/DMR-380-CPEditor.php),
with a [download link](https://www.miklor.com/DMR/software/DMR_CPE.1.1.21.zip).

The "official" code plug editor (CPE) is used to write the data to the radio. 

Unfortunately the software only support windows, so either use Virtual
Box (or another virtual machine platform) to run thw windows software.
